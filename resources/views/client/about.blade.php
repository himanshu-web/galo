                <b>About Galo Language</b>
Galo is a language of the Tani branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family, one of the largest and most diverse language families in the world. According to Sun (1993; 2003) and Post (2007), Galo is classified as a Western Tani language.
In 2008, the State Assembly of Arunachal Pradesh approved recognition of Galo as an Official Language of areas of Arunachal Pradesh in which Galo speakers predominate, with a distinct grammar and script. In early 2009, the International Standards Organization (ISO 639-3) also recognized the existence of Galo language, and recorded the official name of the language as “Galo”.

							<p class="text-justify"><b>`Galoo Ennam</b>
The script of Galo language “`Galoo Ennam”, a Modified Roman Script was developed by the Galo Language Development Committee in 2008. `Galoo Ennam was developed to represent the sounds of Galo language simply, but also as accurately as possible. It is also designed to be accessible, in the sense of being found on all existing computers, typewriters, mobile phones, and so on. Use of a phonetically accurate script such as `Galoo Ennam is especially important in books on `goqku agom and other kinds of poetic language that most people may not already know.
<br>
Since Galo Script is not a variety of English Script, the order used here is the Sanskrit-derived devānagāri order. This is the order which is usually used to alphabetize Asian languages, and has been used in Japanese, Burmese, Khmer, Tibetan, Thai, Lao, Newari and Meithei, among others. This order has been chosen because it is a) scientifically-based and b) able to accurately organize the phonology (sound patterns) of the Galo language. For example, all the vowels are grouped first, then the consonants in order of place of articulation (from the back of the mouth k to the front p) followed by manner of articulation (voiceless k, voiced g and nasal q for all the stops, followed by liquids l, r and then fricatives s, h). 
<br>
`Galoo Ennam has seven vowels, seventeen consonants and two tones. Among vowels, two unfamiliar symbols may be w and v; they represent the sounds in `wlww ‘stone’ and `vmv ‘fire’. i and e represent the sounds in `isi ‘water’ and mee ‘many’ only. Among consonants, two unfamiliar symbols will be q and x, which represent the sounds in aqo ‘different’ and axi ‘elder sister’. The reason these symbols are chosen instead of ng and ny is to allow Galo writers to represent the difference between long and short consonants, as in aqqo ‘five’ and axxi ‘little’. Finally, though there are two tones in Galo – high/plain and low/tense – only the low/tense tone is marked, as in `tabv ‘sugar cane’. The high/plain tone is not marked, as in tabv ‘snake’. The pronunciation of a high/plain tone is usually basically the same, no matter which context it is in – there is a relatively high, level pitch throughout the word. The pronunciation of a low/tense word can differ strongly depending on the shape of the word and the context in which it occurs. However, there is always some sort of pitch movement on a low/tense word; it is never level and plain.
